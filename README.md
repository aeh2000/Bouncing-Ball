#PROGRESS
Week1
- coming up with my idea, laying everything out, finding reference
- I used my midterm as reference to create my game

Week 2
- Started illustrating the icons I used in my game
- figuring out how to write the code to make it do what I want

Week 3
- importing image files
- I had complications with the asteroid falling from the sky
- I tried getting help from 2 different IT's but none of them were able to figure out where exactly the problem in my code was happening.
- Wrote completely new code in a way that I could understand it

Week 4
- coded a new game from my original idea
- I've included my old game in the github so you could see where my problems were.


#CHALLENGES
- The problem I was having with my old game was the fact that when I clicked the mouse, the asteroid dropped at one location, and only dropped when the mouse was pressed. I wanted the asteroids to fall at an accelerating rate, but I wasn't sure how to get the asteroids to do that.
