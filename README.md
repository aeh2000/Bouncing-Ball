#Progress

Week1
-coming up with my idea, laying everything out, finding reference
-I used my midterm as reference to create my game

Week 2
-Started illustrating the icons I used in my game
-figuring out how to write the code to make it do what I want

Week 3
-importing image files
-I had complications with the asteroid falling from the sky
-I tried getting help from 2 different IT's but none of them were able to figure out where exactly the problem in my code was happening.
-Wrote completely new code in a way that I could understand it

Week 4
-coded a new game from my original idea
-I've included my old game in the github so you could see where my problems were.
